[How to Build a Private AI Agent with Ollama and LlamaIndex](https://datavizandai.github.io/2024/10/18/ollama-agent.html)

This contains the files to support the article linked to above. It is a project that uses the LlamaIndex ReactAgent and couples it with a local LLM running via Ollama.


_Files_

- ``ollamasanitycheck.py`` - a simple invocation of the local LLM to make sure everything is working fine.
- ``basicllamaagent.ipynb`` - all of the code from the article in a Jupyter Notebook
